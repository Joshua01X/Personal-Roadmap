This project represents a personal roadmap I developed to solidify my understanding of cybersecurity fundamentals. It is a visual representation of the key resources, certifications, and tools I've utilized to build a robust foundation in this field. The diagram helps illustrate how various sources, learning platforms, and certifications connect to form a cohesive learning strategy.

The project is intended to serve as both a knowledge organizer and a living document that will be updated as I gain more experience and certifications in cybersecurity.

## Objective

The main objective of this diagram is to organize and visualize the diverse learning resources and certifications that I have leveraged to build a strong foundation in cybersecurity. By categorizing and connecting various tools, courses, and certifications, I aim to:

- Track my progress in mastering cybersecurity concepts.
- Showcase my commitment to continuous learning.
- Provide a clear path for others who may be interested in following a similar learning journey.

## Technology Employed

- **Draw.io**: Used to create the cybersecurity knowledge map diagram.

## Contexts In Each Section

### Fundamentals
The "Fundamentals" node sits at the core of the map, representing the foundational knowledge that connects all other resources, tools, and certifications. This core is crucial for cybersecurity, as it encompasses the basic principles that guide your learning and practical experience. These fundamentals include understanding cybersecurity concepts like confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad), risk management, and the essential tools for threat detection and prevention.

Why it’s essential: Without a strong grasp of the fundamentals, it would be difficult to interpret advanced materials or apply practical skills. This node emphasizes the integration of theoretical knowledge with practical tools, ensuring a balanced learning experience.
### Sources
The sources provide the raw materials and knowledge base for your cybersecurity learning, from high-level overviews to in-depth technical tutorials. This section explains where you gather your learning material and how each source plays a role in shaping your understanding.
